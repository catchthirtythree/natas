The note that's given on the website is a little odd. I just took it to mean that these sites shared sessions. So whatever was in the session in one site, if I took the `PHPSESSID` and used it on the other site, the session would be the same. The code on the experimenter site pretty puts whatever you put in the request into the session. There was not much more to it than that.
