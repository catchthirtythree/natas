# natas17

Very similar to `natas15` except we don't get any output from the server. I really wanted to try an out-of-band attack here since we've done the blind boolean attacks but the code I was trying wasn't working and I realized that my knowledge of these kinds of attacks is extremely weak after spending way too long on it. So I ended up going with something very similar to `natas15` with an additional step to make it a time-based attack.

A super fun thing to note is that this script also works for `natas15`. I know this because I copy-pasted that code, altered it and accidentally ran it against `natas15` before running it against `natas17`...
