# natas10

When you view the source code you'll notice that the key that you pass in is used directly on the command line. You'll notice that they attempt to use some regex to filter out `;`, `|` and `&`. We can still short circuit the grep call and `cat` the natas11 webpass.

`. cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10`
