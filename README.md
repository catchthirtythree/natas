# natas

This is my repository for the overthewire.org wargame [natas](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/).

Each directory will have a README and some code if necessary that describes how I found the passwords. I'm fairly new to these games and very rambly so the descriptions may or may not make sense to you.
