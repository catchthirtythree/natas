If you view the source code, you'll see an `$encodedSecret` which is a hexidecimal string. In the code, they take the input that you send, run it through the `encodeSecret` function and compare it to the `$encodedSecret` meaning that `$encodedSecret` has also been through these steps so we must reverse it.
